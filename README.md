# Task 5: Data Analysis on CSV Files

##  Objective
Analyze sales data using **Pandas** to extract insights and visualize results.

##  Tools
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**

##  Deliverables
- Jupyter Notebook with clean, documented code
- Charts and visualizations showcasing sales trends

##  Hints / Mini Guide
1. **Load CSV using Pandas**  
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   df = pd.read_csv("sales_data.csv")

   
This structure makes your README concise yet professional, and it aligns perfectly with your internship deliverables.  

Would you like me to also add a **sample chart screenshot section** (with placeholders) so your README looks more visually complete, or keep it purely text-based?
